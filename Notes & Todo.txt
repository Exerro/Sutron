Remake the whole structure system
	It should literally just use the structure resource/feature
	In the map, there should just be if structure:canSpawn( ... ) then dostuff
	
	Pretty much done, just need to make some tweaks with the height limitations that structures can give

Add explosions
	Break blocks
	Push entities

Add particle effects
	Sparkles and stuff
	Use pixels with velocity, size, intensity and colour/image
	Can add these to explosions too :)
